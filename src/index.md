# Welcome to the TU-DO Makerspace 3D Printer Maintance Book

The goal of this documentation is to collect and archive general usage and maintenance information for the 3D printers in the TU-DO Makerspace.

For each printer, the documentation should contain the following information:

- Printer specifications: This includes information on the printer's technical specifications and any modifications made to it, compared to the original specifications.
- Slicer settings: The slicer settings that work best with the printer.
- Firmware information: Which firmware is installed on the printer and how to update it or flash it, if necessary.
- Printer usage guide: A general guide on how to use the printer, including basic operating instructions, safety precautions, and recommended settings.
- Known issues: A list of known issues and their potential impact on the printer's performance or safety.
- Disassembly and reassembly guide: Instructions on how to disassemble and reassemble the printer, should any repair or maintenance work be required.
- Troubleshooting guide: A list of common problems that users may encounter while operating the printer, along with their solutions or workarounds.

This documentation is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/TU-DO-Makerspace/TU-DO_3D-Printer-Maintenance) and is generated using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). The static site is hosted on GitHub Pages. All markdown files are located in the `src` folder, and the `docs` folder is generated by MkDocs and should not be edited manually.

If you plan on contributing to the documentation, it is recommended that you become familiar with MkDocs first. The [MkDocs documentation](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/) provides a good overview of the syntax used to write the documentation.
